## Data Manipulation

-- Removing Null values & text processing in the dataframe.
-- Lowercasing, lemmatisation, stemming, HTML removal in text.

## TFIDF Vectorisation

-- To convert the review text into vector we use TFIDF vectorisation technique.
-- Machine Learning models appied : SVC, RandomForest, Logistic Regression, NaiveBayes & Decision Tree.

## CF Based Recommendation

-- Taking the pre existing user vs item scores and then mapping similar user's item scores with the existing user's given item scores.

-- Similar approach for item based CF algorithm and we observe that the user based matching is better in terms of MAE scores.
